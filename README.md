# NextBus
Minimalist Chrome extension to display times of next buses passing by

# Description
If
- you're on your desktop
- about to leave and take a bus
- want to be at the station when the bus arrives
- don't want to do many actions to get your info from
    - the TCL website
    - the TCL mobile app
Then
- you click on this extension's icon in Chrome
- it displays the next times the buses pass by your station

# New Version
If you need this extension to do more then contact me and I'll be glad to improve it.

# Current version
- I haven't put this into Chrome's Web store (yet) because I'm the only one using it
- So it needs to be installed via developer mode

- I only need this for one given station
- So it only supports that for now

- I haven't needed to change the station so there is no extension setting for it yet
- Use the stop ID variable (get it from the timetable sheet of each station) if you want to change the station
